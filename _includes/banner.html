        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </header>

      <p>I am always looking for the next data science project to bring meaningful improvement to the world. I've moved the needle developing algorithms for large scale energy storage, precision human bionics, and drug therapeutics discovery. I have a masters degree in structural engineering from Stanford.</p>

      <p>When I'm not storytelling with data in a Jupyter Notebook, you'll find me outside running, cycling, or skiing.</p>
