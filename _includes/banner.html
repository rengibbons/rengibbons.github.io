        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </header>

      <p>I am always looking for the next data science project to bring meaningful improvement to the world. I've moved the needle developing algorithms for large scale energy storage, precision human bionics, and drug therapeutics discovery. I have a masters degree in structural engineering from Stanford.</p>

      <p>When I'm not storytelling with data in a Jupyter Notebook, you'll find me playing outside or heads down on my latest project. Running, cycling, skiing, and backpacking are my go-to activities outside, including hiking 2,600 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail in 2018. Some of my latest personal projects include woodworking, crocheting stuffed animals, Raspberry Pi tinkering, and maintaining an indoor garden.</p>
