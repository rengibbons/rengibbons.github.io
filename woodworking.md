title: Woodworking

<p>I recently started woodworking. I didn't own any tools, and I didn't have any formal training. I didn't have access to a woodshop, and I didn't have much space since I was renting a room in a house. I knew I'd have to choose projects that I could do with limited tools.</p>

<p>My first project was a dining table. This was my simplest project to date but also the highest stakes since 8/4 ended up costing more than I was expecting ($300 in lumber). In theory, this project is straight forward. I would buy the lumber premilled to s4s, and the remaining steps would be far from rocket science.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Glue the boards together.</li>
    <li>Cut the ends square.</li>
    <li>Sand all surfaces smooth.</li>
    <li>Finish with a couple layers of polyurethane.</li>
    <li>Bolt hairpin legs to the bottom..</li>
    <li>.</li>
    <li>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, the project was much more difficult that this. I learned that buying milled lumber comes with no quarantee of straightness. By the time I had the lumber home, each plank was warped by at least a few millimeters. Given these boards are nearly 2" thick, it is extremely difficult to clamp the warp out during the glue up. I ended up with a glued table top with unevenly glued planks. With a mill, I'd be able to shave the unevenness off in a few seconds, but I only had sandpaper. After many nights of sanding, the table was smooth by feel and mostly flat. Once I was happy with the smoothness, I finished the surface and attached the legs.</p>
